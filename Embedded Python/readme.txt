These scripts are part of my work in UPRM's MoonBuggy Team.

PyScript.py was one of the first implementations of the now correctly named
Parser.py. PyScript.py is therefore deprecated and not in use. It is here for
history reasons and why not have your first codes to look back on right? jajajaja

Parser.py is largely functional but has theoric implementations as of 11/24/2020
so running it will result in errors as expected.

The pre-processor script is a theoric implementation as of 11/24/2020.

Multithreading script is planned to be implemented in the same way.
Will update once that is finished.
