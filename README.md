All my scripts in different programming languages.

Some are just practice scripts, others are class scripts, code snippets and research code.
Will be updated periodically.
Almost all script's comment and/or documentation are in Spanish, which should not remove the quality of the code. Judge the code for what it is.

Hope you like this.
